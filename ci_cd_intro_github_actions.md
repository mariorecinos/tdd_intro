## Bonus: Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions ##
<p>
In this bonus section, we'll explore how to set up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) using GitHub Actions for our is_palindrome project. CI/CD is a crucial practice in modern software development that helps automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and streamlining development workflows.

1. Create A Github Actions Workflow

* In your GitHub repository, create a new directory named .github/workflows.

* Inside the .github/workflows directory, create a YAML file (e.g., ci_cd.yml) for defining your GitHub Actions workflow.

Here's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow for Python:
```python3
name: Python CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.x  # Choose your Python version

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: python -m unittest unittest_test.py

    - name: Check test results and prevent push on failure
      run: |
        if [ ${{ job.status }} == "failure" ]; then
          echo "Tests failed. Preventing code push."
          exit 1
        fi
```

This workflow does the following:

* It triggers on every push to the main branch.
* It sets up a Python environment, installs project dependencies, and runs the tests.
